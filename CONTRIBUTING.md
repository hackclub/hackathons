# Contribution Guidelines

#### This document contains a set of guidelines that any contributions to any Hack Club repository must follow.

## Welcome Hackers!

### Step 1: Fork repo.

Fork the original repo [hackathons](https://github.com/hackclub/hackathons) !

![Fork](https://cloud-99tamsbv5-hack-club-bot.vercel.app/0fork.png)

After this step, you'll get your copy of the repo.

![forked](https://cloud-99tamsbv5-hack-club-bot.vercel.app/1forked.png)

Something in your URL would look like this:

- https://github.com/\<your-username>/hackathons

### Step 2: Clone the forked repo

Copy the URL

```cli
git clone https://github.com/<your-username>/hackathons.git
```

### Step 3: Make a new branch

```cli
cd hackathons
```

```cli
git checkout -b <name-of-your-branch>
```

### Step 4: Make your Awesome changes!

eg: In my case, I was adding the CONTRIBUTING.md

### Step 5: Add, Commit and Push

```cli
git add .
```

```cli
git commit -m "commit message you want to add!"
```

```cli
git push -u origin <your-branch-name>
```

### Step 6: Make a pull request

Make a Pull request from your branch, to the main branch of the original repo.

- Go to your forked repo.
- You'll see an option to make pull-request
